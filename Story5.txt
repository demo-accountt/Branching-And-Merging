The Fox and the Grapes

A hungry fox was walking past a vineyard when he saw some ripe, juicy grapes hanging from a vine. They looked so delicious! The fox jumped high to grab them but couldn’t reach them, no matter how hard he tried. Tired and frustrated, the fox walked away, grumbling, “Those grapes are probably sour anyway!” But deep down, he knew he had just given up too quickly.

Moral of the story: Don’t make excuses when something is hard—keep trying!
