The Lion and the Poor Slave

A kind slave ran away from his cruel master and hid in the forest. There, he saw a lion roaring in pain because a big thorn was stuck in its paw. Even though he was scared, the slave helped the lion by pulling the thorn out. The lion went back into the woods, free and happy. Later, the slave was caught and sent to be punished by being thrown into a lion’s den. But the lion didn’t harm him—it was the same lion he had helped!

Moral of the story: A good deed is never forgotten. Be kind, and kindness will come back to you.
