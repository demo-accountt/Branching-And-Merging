The Boy Who Cried Wolf

There was a young boy whose job was to watch over the village sheep. One day, he was bored and wanted some fun, so he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf!” The villagers came running to help, only to find the boy laughing at them because there was no wolf. The next day, he did it again, and the villagers were angry. Later, a real wolf came and started attacking the sheep. The boy cried, “Wolf! Wolf!” But this time, no one believed him, and the wolf ran off with some sheep.

Moral of the story: If you keep lying, no one will trust you—even when you’re telling the truth!
