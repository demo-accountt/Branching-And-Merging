The Elephant and the Ants

A big, proud elephant loved bullying smaller animals. Every day, he sprayed water at the ant hill, making life difficult for the tiny ants. One day, the ants decided to teach him a lesson. They crawled into his trunk and started biting him from the inside! The elephant danced and howled in pain until he begged for forgiveness. He promised to never hurt the ants or anyone else again.

Moral of the story: No one is too small to make a difference. Be kind to everyone, no matter how big or small they are.
